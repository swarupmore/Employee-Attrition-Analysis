## Problem statement 

XYZ company which was established few years back is facing around 15% attrition rate for the couple of years.
And it's majorly affecting the company in many aspects. In order to understand why employees are leaving the company 
and reduce the attrition rate, XYZ company has approached HR analytics consultancy for analyzing the data they have.

I'm playing the HR analyst role in this project and build a dashboard which can help the organization in taking data driven decision.

## Summary

As an HR analyst for XYZ Company, I built a powerful dashboard to investigate the root causes of the company's 15% attrition rate over the past few years. 
The dashboard yielded valuable insights to help the organization make data-driven decisions and reduce employee turnover.

## Key Findings

1. Job Level 2 employees experienced the highest attrition rate, raising concerns about their job satisfaction and retention.
2.Employees in the age group of 29-35 were the most affected, pointing to potential challenges in retaining mid-career professionals.
3. Research scientists, despite receiving higher pay, exhibited a significant departure rate in Job Level 2, indicating potential issues within their work environment or career growth prospects.
4. Low job satisfaction emerged as a common theme among employees who left, emphasizing the importance of addressing employee engagement.
5. The dashboard highlighted salary disparities, with managers who left the company earning an average of 7,000 less than their counterparts who stayed.
6. Outside of work-related factors, health issues and maternity breaks emerged as occasional reasons for attrition.

With these data-driven revelations, XYZ Company is now equipped to implement targeted measures to enhance job satisfaction, work-life balance, and overall employee experience. By addressing the identified pain points, the company aims to foster a positive work culture and reduce attrition, driving improved organizational performance and long-term success.
